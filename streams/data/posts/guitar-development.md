## Background

I have played guitar for around 20 years, one of my favorite personal pastimes. I have always been interested in learning to play whatever I heard in my head. [Guitar.dev](https://guitar.dev) is a project I started to help myself and others reach that goal.

> Guitar.dev is a Laravel 9 + Streams application using Tailwind, AlpineJS, and Streams UI for it's frontend.

### Mission + Focus

The mission is to build an interface that helps teach guitar players knowledge of and creative application of music theory to their playing in order to help attain musical freedom.

The core focuses of this project are:

- Effective and progressive practe
- Music theory and application to guitar
- Creative development, phrasing and timing

---

As well as:

- Song construction and composition
- Interval training and decoding music

## Practice Timer

First thing first, I wanted to build a very simple practice timer as the first tool. This practice timer imposes a mandatory metronome. When clicked, the timer starts and when clicked again it pauses, and the duration and timestamp is stored for later. The metronome will also need controls to adjust the tempo quickly and easily.

### Installation
### Configuration
### Timer Component
